    abstract = {Cryptographic hash functions provide a basic data authentication mechanism and are used pervasively as building blocks to realize many cryptographic functionalities, including block ciphers, message authentication codes, key exchange protocols, and encryption and digital signature schemes. Since weaknesses in hash functions may imply vulnerabilities in the constructions that build upon them, ensuring their security is essential. Unfortunately, many widely used hash functions, including SHA-1 and MD5, are subject to practical attacks. The search for a secure replacement is one of the most active topics in the field of cryptography. In this paper we report on the first machine-checked and independently-verifiable proofs of collision-resistance and indifferentiability of Merkle-Damgaard, a construction that underlies many existing hash functions. Our proofs are built and verified using an extension of the EasyCrypt framework, which relies on state-of-the-art verification tools such as automated theorem provers, SMT solvers, and interactive proof assistants.},

    abstract = {Keccak-based algorithms such as Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) will be widely used in cryptosystems, and evaluating their security against different kinds of attacks is vitally important. This paper presents an efficient differential fault analysis (DFA) method on all four modes of SHA-3 to recover an entire internal state, which leads to message recovery in the regular hashing mode and key retrieval in the message authentication code (MAC) mode. We adopt relaxed fault models in this paper, assuming the attacker can inject random single-byte faults into the penultimate round input of SHA-3. We also propose algorithms to find the lower bound on the number of fault injections needed to recover an entire internal state for the proposed attacks. Results show that on average, the attacker needs about 120 random faults to recover an internal state, while he needs 17 faults at best if he has control of the faults injected. The proposed attack method is further extended for systems with input messages longer than the bitrate.},

    abstract="In this paper we present the first differential fault analysis (DFA) of SHA-3. This attack can recover the internal state of two versions of SHA-3 (namely, SHA3-512 and SHA3-384) and can be used to forge MAC's which are using these versions of SHA-3. Assuming that the attacker can inject a random single bit fault on the intermediate state of the hash computation, and given the output of the SHA-3 version for a correct message and 80 faulty messages, we can extract 1592 out of the 1600 bits of the compression function's internal state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public analysis of SHA-3 against DFA. Although our results do not compromise any security claim of SHA-3, it shows the feasibility of DFA on this scheme and possibly other Sponge based MACs and increases our understanding of SHA-3.",
